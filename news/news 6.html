            <h1>BUGATTI ANNOUNCES SENIOR APPOINMENTS</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="body">
            <p>Christophe piochon, president of bugatti automobiles, welcomes the new appointments: “florent ligi and philippe grand join bugatti at an enormously exciting time, on the cusp of a new era for our legendary brand. their appointments ensure we continue to evolve our team with people that have a deep understanding and passion for the automotive and technology sectors, ready to play a key role in helping bugatti prepare for its exciting future.”</p>
            <p>Philippe Grand has been an automotive quality specialist for two decades, establishing the reputation for quality and reliability of some of the world’s most significant brands; Porsche, Volkswagen, Bentley, Lamborghini and more. In his role at Bugatti he will be responsible for ensuring the consistently high standards for both reliability at the very limits of performance and perfection in every unique, ultra-customisable detail.</p>
            <p>Grand says: “Working for Bugatti has always been the ultimate ambition for me. I have admired the engineering innovation of this brand ever since I was a child, growing up with the EB110 of the 1990s. My predecessors have done incredible work establishing Bugatti quality as the best in the world, and as we now shift focus to Bolide1, the new W16 Mistral2 and the Bugatti Rimac era beyond, I will work with the engineering team here to ensure that world-class reputation remains intact.”</p>
            <p>Florent Ligi has an impressive track record of working in senior HR positions for companies that support the automotive and technology sectors, most recently as Human Resources Director at Pôle Formation UIMM Alsace, which specializes in developing and training people across a wide spectrum of industrial and technological fields. He has a Master’s degree in Business Economics from the University of Lille and also has a European Master in Management degree. With a lifelong passion for cars that was fueled by his upbringing in a home where Bugatti automobiles were revered, Ligi remembers the day he saw the Bugatti Veyron for the first time in 2006 and “fell in love.”</p>
            <p>Florent Ligi says: “The future of Bugatti is incredibly exciting, and I am honored to join it on its journey. I am looking forward to continuing and further developing the constructive social dialogue within the company.”</p>
            <p>As the world enters a time of great change that affects all industries, Bugatti is determined to prepare all of its staff and strengthen their ties to the company. “The employees are the focus of the company at Bugatti and always have been,” says Christophe Piochon. “We are in very exciting and fast-moving times and we will move into this new era together as one.”</p>
